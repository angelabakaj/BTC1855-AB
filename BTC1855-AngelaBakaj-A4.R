Read the data into a dataframe

Check and correct structural issues

Identify the possible data (content) issues

Your downstream analysis will require the variables 'country', 'shape' and 'duration seconds'.
Analyze these columns, identify any problems (e.g. missingness, outliers, inconsistency etc) and implement your solution (e.g. remove, impute etc).

NUFORC officials comment on sightings that may be hoax. 
Identify the best way to identify and remove these sightings from the dataset.

Add another column to the dataset (report_delay) and populate with the time difference in days,
between the date of the sighting and the date it was reported.

Remove the rows where the sighting was reported before it happened.

Create a table with the average report_delay per country.

Create a histogram using the 'duration seconds' column.
